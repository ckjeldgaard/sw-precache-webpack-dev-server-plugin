## Install

```sh
$ yarn add --dev sw-precache-webpack-dev-plugin
```

or
```sh
$ npm install --save sw-precache-webpack-dev-plugin
```

### How it works

To generate precache manifest in service worker, this plugin must be applied after all of assets has been emmited by webpack compiling. this plugin will write a file in temporory to data space in memory-fs and webpack dev server will be served by filepath.

## Usage

See [basic webpack config files](./example/webpack.config.js) at examples.

### How to test

You can test this plugin by running example application with below commands. It will manage a service worker script while webpack devserver is running. Warn you, you need to make sure that the previous service worker script must be ungresitered or refleshed before you test with a newer version script of updating service worker configuration at webpack config.

```sh
$ yarn start
```

or
```sh
$ npm start
```

and open browser, visit to `localhost:8080`

## Configuration

It will accept and pass through all of [options parameter of sw-precache](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache#options-parameter) to [sw-precache](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache). By the way, there are more options and a few of specical way to treats passed configurations.

### sw-precache Configurations

- staticFileGlobs: [Array<String>] - Default is empty array, allow dev server to cache all of files in assets on webpack complilation

### Plugin Configurations
